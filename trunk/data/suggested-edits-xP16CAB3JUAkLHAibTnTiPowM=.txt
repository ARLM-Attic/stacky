After spending 2 days searching for a great PHP editor, I settled for Eclipse's PDT. <br />\nSo far, I've enabled some of the intellisense features, but not the following: <br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1) In Dreamweaver, whenever the '$\" symbol is typed, the software\n  brings up a list of all the global functions and variables ($_SERVER,\n  $_POST, $_GET, $_REQUEST, etc). I haven't been able to reproduce that\n  in PDT. <br /> 2)In Dreamweaver, whenever the 'new' keyword is typed,\n  all the classes are displayed, along with their parameters. Even\n  though some of the classes are displayed in PDT, the arguments for the\n  classes are not included.So, if I decide to use a class, I have no\n  idea what parameters to pass into the constructor. <br /> 3) In\n  Dreamweaver, I don't have to create a project before starting a PHP\n  application; just create a folder, and start; it seems I have to\n  always start by creating a project in Eclipse. <br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, 4 main questions: <br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Is there a way to solve the first problem? <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;2)Is there a way to solve the second problem? i would very\n  much try to avoid opening up a PHP.net manual every time I need to\n  code. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;3) Is there a way to start a project without\n  creating one? Do I have to build the project after it's complete\n  before I can use it as an application?\n  How do I modify existing PHP applications in Eclipse without creating a new project? <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;4) If all these are impossible, is there a free or low budget (&lt;= $100) IDE with all these features that I can use? <br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n","comment":"Improved formatting","creation_date":1323643065,"approval_date":1323643085,"proposing_user":{"user_id":711170,"display_name":"Darren Burgess","reputation":510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8372d6c4ba72bdaf4270328fce3ffec2?d=identicon&r=PG","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/711170/darren-burgess"}},{"suggested_edit_id":156592,"post_id":8468046,"post_type":"question","body":"<p>I have a silly question regarding how to enforce the layout of a control to be recalculated after the content has been set by databinding.

Here are the snippets:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public UIElement AnnotationControl {\n    get {\n        if (_currentAnnotation != null &amp;&amp;\n            typeof(Control).IsAssignableFrom(_currentAnnotation.GetType())) {\n            return (Control)_currentAnnotation;\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Canvas x:Name=\"annotationCanvas\"\n        DataContext=\"{Binding Path=AnnotationViewModel}\"\n        Panel.ZIndex=\"20\" Visibility=\"Visible\"\n        Height=\"{Binding ElementName=control,Path=ActualHeight}\"\n        Width=\"{Binding ElementName=control,Path=ActualWidth}\"&gt;\n    &lt;ContentControl x:Name=\"drawingControl\"\n                    Visibility=\"Visible\"\n                    Content=\"{Binding Path=CurrentAnnotationControl}\"&gt;\n    &lt;/ContentControl&gt;\n&lt;/Canvas&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The UIElement is created dynamically and updated frequently while dragging the mouse.
