It was repainted each time the drawpanel is mouseovered after the window (not just the panel) lost focus once.</p>\n\n<p>Some code:\n(I know the tool selection implementation isn't the best :P)</p>\n\n<p>DrawPanel's paintComponent method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) { \n    if(isMousePressed) {\n        if(tool == \"BRUSH\") {\n            g.setColor(color);\n            g.fillOval(currentEvent.getX(), currentEvent.getY(), 30, 30);\n        } else if(tool == \"ERASER\") {\n            g.setColor(getBackground());\n            g.fillOval(currentEvent.getX(), currentEvent.getY(), 30, 30);\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let me know if there is any relevant information or code that I left out.</p>\n\n<p>Hypothesis:\nI didn't call super.paintComponent in DrawPanels paintComponent-method, maybe that causes some problems? The reason that I didn't is that if I do, it will repaint the background all the time so only the dot I painted last will be visible. Not sure if the supercall actually solves the problem or if the fake-panel is just covered by the background as well. Maybe I need to work around that some other way?
